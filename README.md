1. Predicting Employee Exit
  Max Score: 100

 We will be working on Employee Data. This is employee attrition data. The 'left'    named column represents exit from the company or not.

 The data consists of categorical & number data. Thus, needs data preprocessing.    Make use of preprocessing techniques that you have learnt & build model to    predict 'left' named column

2. Estimate the total compensation to be provided to an employee
  Max Score: 50

Imagine you are working as a data scientist in a big organization which has thousands of employees. The HR department is planning to provide some additional compensation to each working employee which needs to be calculated by looking at the profile of each employee and the benefits they are getting. 

The HR department asks your help if you can use your data science and machine learning skills and calculate an estimated ‘Total Compensation’ for each employee.

Data Description

﻿OGC: Organization Group Code - Org Group is a group of Departments. For example, the Public Protection Org Group includes departments such as the Police, Fire, Adult Probation, District Attorney, and Sheriff.

OG: Organization Group names

DC: Department Code - Departments are the primary organizational unit used by the City and County of San Francisco. Examples include Recreation and Parks, Public Works, and the Police Department.

Dept: Department name

UC: Union Code - Unions represent employees in collective bargaining agreements. A job belongs to one union, although some jobs are unrepresented (usually temporarily).

Union: Union names

JF: Job Family - Job Family combines similar Jobs into meaningful groups.

Job: Job name

EI: Employee Identifier

Salaries: Salary of the employee

Overtime: Amounts paid to City employees working in excess of 40 hours per week. 

H/D: Health/Dental - City-paid premiums to health and dental insurance plans covering City employees. To protect confidentiality as legally required, pro-rated citywide averages are presented in lieu of employee-specific health and dental benefits. 

YT: Year Type - Fiscal (July through June) or Calendar (January through December)

Total_Compensation: The final compensation i.e. the sum of all salaries and benefits paid to City employees.

3.Obesity Trends
  Max Score: 100

Obesity is a worldwide problem which causes a lot of serious medical problems. Obesity will be increased, about 45% out of the whole population by 2035. The proportion of morbid obese and the actual costs on healthcare will be increased. Implementation of a system that could estimate the percentage of obese population for particular time duration given the age range, income range, location, high confidence level and low confidence level of obesity, education, gender, the class level, etc. of the population can help in fight against obesity.

Build a machine learning model to estimate the percentage of obese population.

4.House Price Prediction
  Max Score: 100

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes, build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house
